PlayerSimulator

Ported to 1.8.8 Spigot from [1.7](https://github.com/GenericPNP/blplugins/blob/master/playersimulator/src/com/probablycoding/bukkit/playersimulator/) made by BadLion, with varity of improvements on the top of that

PlayerSimulator could make be used in the development, for example, a pressure testing, or some fun activities

Mostly won't maintain that much because I was just porting this, could probably add some configurations or extra features if requested, I don't know
